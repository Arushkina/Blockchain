# Blockchain Project

This project aims to create a simplified implementation of a blockchain framework in Java, covering fundamental components like blocks, transactions, encryption, consensus mechanisms, Merkle trees, and more.

## Project Overview

The project delves into building a foundational structure for a blockchain network in Java, demonstrating key concepts and functionalities. It encompasses classes and utilities for managing blocks, validating transactions, securing data through encryption, achieving consensus through Proof of Work (PoW), establishing Merkle trees for efficient data verification, and handling transaction logic.

## Project Structure
### Block
The `block` package contains classes related to blocks in the blockchain, including the structure of a block and utility methods.

### Consensus
The `consensus` package currently includes Proof of Work (PoW) implementation.

### Encryption
The `encryption` package holds implementations for asymmetric encryption and related utility methods.

### Merkle
The `merkle` package involves Merkle tree implementation and utility functions.

### Signature
The `signature` package comprises digital signature functionalities and associated utilities.

### Transaction
The `transaction` package includes transaction-related classes and management utilities.

### Utils
The `utils` package contains Hashing utilities utilized across the project.

## Future Packages (Upcoming)

Future developments may introduce the following packages:

- Network: Handling peer-to-peer communication and network management.
- Wallet: Managing user wallets and related operations.
- BlockchainManager: Core logic for managing the blockchain.
- BlockValidator: Validation of blocks and transactions.
- TransactionPool: Handling unconfirmed transactions.
- BlockStorage: Handling block storage.
- BlockchainConfiguration: Storing blockchain configurations.
- And more...
